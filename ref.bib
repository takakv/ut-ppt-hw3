                    preventing the disclosure of private data as information is
                    transmitted and processed. Although business process model
                    and notation (BPMN) is well suited for expressing
                    stakeholder collaboration and business processes support by
                    technical solutions, little is done to depict and analyze
                    the flow of private information and its technical safeguards
                    as it is disclosed to process participants. This gap
                    motivates the development of privacy-enhanced BPMN
                    (PE-BPMN)â€”a BPMN language for capturing PET-related
                    activities in order to study the flow of private information
                    and ease the communication of privacy concerns and
                    requirements among stakeholders. We demonstrate its

    abstract    = {Privacy regulations, such as GDPR, impose strict requirements
                    to organizations that store and process private data.
                    Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), such as secure
                    multi-party computation and differential privacy, provide
                    mechanisms to perform computations over private data and to
                    protect the disclosure of private data and derivatives
                    thereof. When PETs are used to protect individual
                    computations or disclosures, their privacy properties and
                    their effect on the utility of the disclosed data can be straightforwardly asserted. However, when multiple PETs are
                    used as part of a complex and possibly inter-organizational
                    business process, it becomes non-trivial for analysts to
                    fully grasp the guarantees that the combined set of PETs
                    provide overall. This article presents a multi-level
                    approach to analyze privacy properties of business processes
                    that rely on PETs to protect private data. The approach is
                    embodied in an open-source toolset, Pleak, that allows
                    analysts to capture privacy-enhanced business process models
                    and to characterize and quantify to what extent the outputs
                    of a process leak information about its inputs. Pleak
                    incorporates an extensible set of analysis plugins, which
                    enable users to inspect potential leakages at multiple

                    Regulation (GDPR) is a challenging task. In this paper, we
                    present a GDPR model and its supporting method to manage
                    compliance to the regulation in business processes. Based on
                    a running example, we illustrate how the method is applied
                    to extract an as-is compliance model that describes
                    non-compliance issues and offers solutions to achieve
                    process compliance. The GDPR model and its method are
                    supported by a software tool. Their feasibility and validity
                    are studied in a few business-oriented cases. The paper also
                    discusses the model completeness with respect to the
